# Simple Sound Pad

Simple sound pad inspired by real professional sound pads. It allows to ascribe music file to the button and play it by pressing the button or key on keyboard.

As a big fun of tabletop RPGs and the game master I felt the urge to have such a program, but I could not find anything similar to it. 

So I created it.

It was also my side project while I was learning python. That is why some more advanced in python people may find totally unnecessary pieces of code in the source code, eg. abstract base class in audio module.

I am aware of that, but I am not going to change this as I believe that it is better to have program with some mistakes in the code then to have a perfect program that does not exist.

Please Notice that the program is still during the development process, therefore some feature may not work properly or at all, eg. pause button. 

If you are among the people that also need such a program please feel welcome to use it.
